A comprehensive solution for searching and managing content that uses specific blocks in Plone and Volto.

## Features ✨

- **Search Blocks**: Search for content using specific block types
- **Search page**: Dedicated page for searching blocks, linked from the user menu of the toolbar
- **Pagination**: Navigate through search results with configurable page sizes
- **Multilingual Support**: Support for multiple languages (Italian included)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **REST API**: RESTful endpoint for programmatic access to block search functionality

## Quick Start 🏁

### Prerequisites ✅

-   An [operating system](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project-cookieplone.html#prerequisites-for-installation) that runs all the requirements mentioned.
-   [uv](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project-cookieplone.html#uv)
-   [nvm](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project-cookieplone.html#nvm)
-   [Node.js and pnpm](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#node-js) 22
-   [Make](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project-cookieplone.html#make)
-   [Git](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project-cookieplone.html#git)
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) (optional)


### Installation 🔧

1.  Clone this repository, then change your working directory.

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:collective/collective-searchblocks.git
    cd collective-searchblocks
    ```

2.  Install this code base.

    ```shell
    make install
    ```


### Fire Up the Servers 🔥

1.  Create a new Plone site on your first run.

    ```shell
    make backend-create-site
    ```

2.  Start the backend at http://localhost:8080/.

    ```shell
    make backend-start
    ```

3.  In a new shell session, start the frontend at http://localhost:3000/.

    ```shell
    make frontend-start
    ```

Voila! Your Plone site should be live and kicking! 🎉

### Local Stack Deployment 📦

Deploy a local Docker Compose environment that includes the following.

- Docker images for Backend and Frontend 🖼️
- A stack with a Traefik router and a PostgreSQL database 🗃️
- Accessible at [http://collective-searchblocks.localhost](http://collective-searchblocks.localhost) 🌐

Run the following commands in a shell session.

```shell
make stack-create-site
make stack-start
```

And... you're all set! Your Plone site is up and running locally! 🚀

## Project structure 🏗️

This monorepo consists of the following distinct sections:

- **backend**: Houses the API and Plone installation, utilizing pip instead of buildout, and includes a policy package named collective.searchblocks.
- **frontend**: Contains the React (Volto) package.
- **devops**: Encompasses Docker stack, Ansible playbooks, and cache settings.
- **docs**: Scaffold for writing documentation for your project.

### Why this structure? 🤔

- All necessary codebases to run the site are contained within the repository (excluding existing add-ons for Plone and React).
- Specific GitHub Workflows are triggered based on changes in each codebase (refer to .github/workflows).
- Simplifies the creation of Docker images for each codebase.
- Demonstrates Plone installation/setup without buildout.

## Code quality assurance 🧐

To check your code against quality standards, run the following shell command.

```shell
make check
```

### Format the codebase

To format and rewrite the code base, ensuring it adheres to quality standards, run the following shell command.

```shell
make format
```

| Section | Tool | Description | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| backend | Ruff | Python code formatting, imports sorting  | [`backend/pyproject.toml`](./backend/pyproject.toml) |
| backend | `zpretty` | XML and ZCML formatting  | -- |
| frontend | ESLint | Fixes most common frontend issues | [`frontend/.eslintrc.js`](.frontend/.eslintrc.js) |
| frontend | prettier | Format JS and Typescript code  | [`frontend/.prettierrc`](.frontend/.prettierrc) |
| frontend | Stylelint | Format Styles (css, less, sass)  | [`frontend/.stylelintrc`](.frontend/.stylelintrc) |

Formatters can also be run within the `backend` or `frontend` folders.

### Linting the codebase
or `lint`:

 ```shell
make lint
```

| Section | Tool | Description | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| backend | Ruff | Checks code formatting, imports sorting  | [`backend/pyproject.toml`](./backend/pyproject.toml) |
| backend | Pyroma | Checks Python package metadata  | -- |
| backend | check-python-versions | Checks Python version information  | -- |
| backend | `zpretty` | Checks XML and ZCML formatting  | -- |
| frontend | ESLint | Checks JS / Typescript lint | [`frontend/.eslintrc.js`](.frontend/.eslintrc.js) |
| frontend | prettier | Check JS / Typescript formatting  | [`frontend/.prettierrc`](.frontend/.prettierrc) |
| frontend | Stylelint | Check Styles (css, less, sass) formatting  | [`frontend/.stylelintrc`](.frontend/.stylelintrc) |

Linters can be run individually within the `backend` or `frontend` folders.

## Internationalization 🌐

Generate translation files for Plone and Volto with ease:

```shell
make i18n
```

## Release 📦

To release a new version of this project, use the automated release process:

```shell
make release
```

### Prerequisites for Release

Before running the release command, set up the required environment variables and authentication:

#### 1. Set Environment Variables

```bash
# PyPI authentication
export UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN="your-pypi-token"

# GitHub (optional, for creating releases)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
```

#### 2. Verify npm Authentication

```bash
npm whoami
```

If this fails, run:
```bash
npm login
```

### What the Release Process Does

The `make release` command automatically:

1. ✅ Verifies required environment variables are set
2. 🔧 Sets up Node.js from `.nvmrc`
3. 🔐 Verifies npm authentication (`npm whoami`)
4. 📦 Installs frontend dependencies (`pnpm install`)
5. 🚀 Runs `uvx repoplone release` to:
   - Update version numbers in both backend and frontend
   - Update CHANGELOG files
   - Create git tags
   - Publish to PyPI (backend) and npm (frontend)
   - Create GitHub releases (if `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set)

### Release Workflow

The release process will ask you to select the next version:
- `a` (alpha): for pre-release versions
- `b` (beta): for beta versions  
- `release`: for stable versions

Then it will:
1. Update repository components (version, CHANGELOG, etc.)
2. Release the backend package to PyPI
3. Release the frontend package to npm
4. Create a git tag
5. Create a GitHub release (if configured)

**Note:** The process is fully automated once started. You only need to confirm the version selection at the beginning.
